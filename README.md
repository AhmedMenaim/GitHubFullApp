This repo is created to introduce the implementation of the clean architecture over the MVVM architecture, In this repo I'm following the approach of the different branches and each branch contains some specific updates.

Some approaches were followed in this repo:

1. Clean architecture with the below diagram
2. Design patterns like a repository to manage the network responses and the cache (If exists)
3. Design patterns like data source to manage the variables that exist in business logic.
4. Using SwiftUI in the UI layer.
5. Network layer from scratch.
6. Depending on modern concurrency (Async, Await)
7. Unit tests for two modules.
8. Dependency injection using [Resolver](https://github.com/hmlongco/Resolver).
9. Dependency injection using [Factory](https://github.com/hmlongco/Factory).

Approaches not implemented yet -> Will be implemented soon **OR** Feel free to implement any of them ✊🏻

1. Coordinator pattern.
2. Add caching.
3. Logger in the Network layer.



The profile page is left empty for you to attach the suitable design you need to talk about yourself, May be I can set a template in it as a portfolio to facilitate the process.
